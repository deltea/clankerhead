This is my journal of the design and building process of **clanker head**.

## 10/4/2025 - i was ideating real good (i wrote a blog post)  

so 2 days ago i went to the bay area maker faire, which is basically a giant convention with people making cool stuff, like electronics, robots, art, and costumes. i saw a bunch of interesting things there, like some indie games and stuff, but one kinda stood out a lot for some reason (idk why).

i saw a robot head thingymajig where it's literally just a box with a screen on the front side of it, and you can wear it and pretend you're a clanka. i was curious, so i looked it up. here's a photo of the thing:

another interesting booth that caught my eye was the *CyberDragon*. it's basically a bunch of adafruit led matrix panels stuck to a helmet, and loaded with custom animations to make it look like a dragon. the single guy who made it takes it to raves, and is starting to sell them for like 3000 dollars. here's a photo

so how do these 2 projects tie into possibly my next project??? here's how: *halloween costume*

i had a random idea to maybe dress up as a clanker for halloween, and just put a box on my head with an led matrix on the front, and make some cool procedural animations to go along with it! i took some inspiration for the animations looking at **tokyo machine's** glassess and also a little robot dude made by dasai called **mochi 3**

> Tokyo Machine's glasses look cool!

so yeah! that's pretty much how i want the style to be like, but i haven't decided on the specifics yet. i realized pretty early that i will have to figure out how to actually see through the headpiece, since the led matrix is opaque. i looked for transparent led matrices, but was out of luck since no one really sells them (and they're expensive). i eventually thought of using some kind of periscope system to use mirrors to bounce light into my eyes so i could see. it honestly seems kinda janky, so i don't know how well it'll work.

## robo sounds

ok so while i was thinking about all this stuff, scope creep started to kick in, and i was like: *"hey why can't i add a voice changer to it, so i actually sound like a frickin clanker? why not???"* and so i started looking into ways i could add a stupid microphone to the inside, and attach a speaker to the outside, and also still somehow have enough portable power to power this entire thng.

## the tech

after thinking about this thing for some time, i have come up with a list of supplies:

- cardboard/3d printed frame (maybe fixed on bike helmet?)
- raspberry pi 3 b+
- 2 portable power banks (both 5v)
- my webcam (used as microphone lol)
- some kinda of speaker
- a bunch of mirrors
- large square head sized led matrix (roughly 6x6 in)

ok that's a pretty big list actually wow.

> Waveshare 64x64 LED Matrix Panel

i think the most crucial part of this project is probably the ability to see out of the box, since you can't really just be walking around blind with this thing. i am also not completely sure if the audio thing would work, since there might be some delay or something idk.

welp, let's get to work i guess.

## 10/5/2025 - did some more research and made a bom  

i basically researched about how i'm gonna make this thing, and made a list of parts i needed, and things i already have that i could use for the project. the final list is something like this:

- led matrix
- old bike helmet or something like that
- m3 machine screws
- mini usb microphone
- white petg filament
- power banks _(already have)_
- raspberry pi 3 _(already have)_
- aux cable _(already have)_
- small display _(already have)_
- usb webcam _(already have)_
- speaker _(already have)_

that's pretty much the entire list! i think the next step is to go to goodwill and look for some cheap used helmets that maybe i could take apart and use as the base of the design. until i have the dimensions of the actual helmet, i feel like it's kinda hard to design. but yeah
